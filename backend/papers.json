Traditionally, designing neural networks is a time-consuming process that requires expertise and substantial trial and error. However, the advent of NAS has opened up possibilities to systematically search for the optimal architecture for a given task. By leveraging machine learning techniques, NAS automates the discovery of architectures that outperform manually designed models. This article delves into the concept of NAS, its components, and various methods utilized in the search process. Furthermore, it explores the challenges and advancements in this field, such as the exploration-exploitation tradeoff, computational efficiency, and transferability across different domains. We also analyze the impact of NAS on several applications, including image classification, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning.

    "abstract": "Rising energy costs, losses in the present-day electricity grid, risks from nuclear power generation, and global environmental changes are motivating a transformation of the conventional ways of generating electricity. Globally, there is a desire to rely more on renewable energy resources (RERs) for electricity generation. RERs reduce greenhouse gas emissions and may have economic benefits, e.g., through applying demand side management with dynamic pricing so as to shift loads from fossil fuel-based generators to RERs. The electricity grid is presently evolving toward an intelligent grid, the so-called smart grid (SG). One of the major goals of the future SG is to move toward 100% electricity generation from RERs, i.e., toward a 100% renewable grid. However, the disparate, intermittent, and typically widely geographically distributed nature of RERs complicates the integration of RERs into the SG. Moreover, individual RERs have generally lower capacity than conventional fossil fuel-based plants, and these RERs are based on a wide spectrum of different technologies. In this article, we give an overview of recent efforts that aim to integrate RERs into the SG. We outline the integration of RERs into the SG along with their supporting communication networks. We also discuss ongoing projects that seek to integrate RERs into the SG around the globe. Finally, we outline future research directions on integrating RERs into the SG.",

    "abstract": "In the present scenario, the fastest-growing environmental concerns are energy management and monitoring. In-efficient energy recycling, energy consumption, energy utilization, and drain characteristic are smart building energy management challenges. Hence to examine the connection between smart city management policies and energy management, this research proposed an Artificial Intelligence Technique for Monitoring Systems in Smart Buildings (AIMS-SB) to manage energy consumption and produce and recycle energy required for a smart building. AIMS-SB helps to predict energy analysis, renewable energy production, and recycling evaluation based on prediction model strategies. AIMS-SB developed eco-design monitoring systems for smart buildings to optimize energy consumption, utilization, and drain characteristics. These efficient implementation strategies and methods for harnessing renewable energy help to improve the safety process, recycling, and reuse of our energy resources for smart building energy management. AIMS-SB provides viable solutions to the growing number of challenges associated with smart city energy management. Therefore, the system's findings demonstrate increased accuracy and efficiency compared to conventional methods.",

    "abstract": "To enable the integration of renewable energy sources into smart grid distribution systems and ensure a continuous energy supply, the utilization of energy storage systems has become critical. Energy storage provides numerous benefits, including energy time shifting, capacity backup, outage management, transmission congestion relief, and power quality improvements, thereby supporting system operators. Nevertheless, smart grid applications encounter various challenges regarding energy storage, such as charge/discharge cycle issues, safety concerns, size limitations, and cost factors. Therefore, the development of energy storage systems that enhance storage performance through improved energy capacity, control, and protection mechanisms is essential. Battery-based storage systems are commonly employed to address the intermittent nature and fluctuations of renewable energy sources like wind and solar power. Additionally, mechanical storage methods are gaining prominence as they contribute to the widespread adoption of clean energy and ensure uninterrupted energy supply. Extensive research endeavors have been undertaken to enhance storage efficiency, reduce costs, and optimize storage duration. This study aims to investigate different energy storage methods, classify them based on their specific purposes, and explore various applications of energy storage. Furthermore, a detailed discussion is provided on the advantages and disadvantages of different energy storage technologies.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a comprehensive review and assessment of the latest research and advancement of electric vehicles (EVs) interaction with smart grid portraying the future electric power system model. The concept goal of the smart grid along with the future deployment of the EVs puts forward various challenges in terms of electric grid infrastructure, communication and control. Following an intensive review on advanced smart metering and communication infrastructures, the strategy for integrating the EVs into the electric grid is presented. Various EV smart charging technologies are also extensively examined with the perspective of their potential, impacts and limitations under the vehicle-to-grid (V2G) phenomenon. Moreover, the high penetration of renewable energy sources (wind and photovoltaic solar) is soaring up into the power system. However, their intermittent power output poses different challenges on the planning, operation and control of the power system networks. On the other hand, the deployment of EVs in the energy market can compensate for the fluctuations of the electric grid. In this context, a literature review on the integration of the renewable energy and the latest feasible solution using EVs with the insight of the promising research gap to be covered up are investigated. Furthermore, the feasibility of the smart V2G system is thoroughly discussed. In this paper, the EVs interactions with the smart grid as the future energy system model are extensively discussed and research gap is revealed for the possible solutions.",
